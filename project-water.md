# Nanotechnological Alternatives to Water Remediation

**Project duration:** September 2016 – July 2022

## Roles & Contributions

**My Contributions**  

- Drew conclusions about the selective **contaminant extraction function** of pure and surface-modified carbon nanotubes based on analysis of interfacial adsorptive structure and dynamics.
  
- **Set up simulation systems** capturing curved adsorption phenomena at the atomic scale for efficient computation with LAMMPS.
  
- Wrote, tested, and employed **de-novo analysis scripts** to characterize how water, small molecule contaminants (mainly benzoic acid, but also naphthoic and anthroic acids), and carbon nanotube surfaces interact.

**Collaborative Contributions**  

- Conducted wet-lab experiments to validate simulation predictions.
  
- Provided sorption capacity measurements from isotherm studies.
  
- Collaborated on joint interpretation of simulation and experimental data to confirm selective contaminant capture.

## Key Discoveries

- Minor surface modification (~1% of surface carbons) via carboxylic functional groups is sufficient to induce **optimum surface capture of benzoic acid**.  

- Benzoic acid is captured more efficiently on grooves of single-walled carbon nanotube bundles than on multi-walled carbon nanotube surfaces.
  
- Findings supported by **molecular dynamics simulations** and **experimental isotherm studies**, linking binding potential and sorption capacity.
