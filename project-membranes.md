# Characterizing Primitive Membrane Formation

**Project duration:** September 2020 – March 2023

## Roles & Contributions

**My Contributions**

- Designed and executed support simulations of **fatty acid and phospholipid assembly** in the context of primitive cell formation.

- Explored **solvation models (implicit and explicit)** to test how cosurfactants like octanoic acid could stabilize primitive membranes.

- Calculated critical packing parameters to demonstrate the stabilizing effects of simple cosurfactants on **membrane formation.**

**Collaborative Contributions**

- Integration of solvation theoretical predictions with observations from **microsopy, spectrometry and organic synthesis.** 

- Contributed simulation insights to the discovery that amino acids and fatty acids can cooperatively assemble into novel, chemically simple, and prebiotically plausible membrane structures.

- Supported broader hypotheses about the origins of life and astrobiological plausibility of **primitive cell-like structures.**

## Key Discoveries

- Both implicit and explicit solvation models suggest that octanoic acid at ≤ equimolar ratios stabilizes primitive membranes — evidenced by critical packing parameter calculations.

- Amino acids can synergize with fatty acids to form stable, prebiotically plausible membranes, offering new perspectives on primitive cell formation on Early Earth and beyond.
