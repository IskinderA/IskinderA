## Key Discoveries

**Based solely on my work (with mentor guidance):**  
- The diffusion model relates the **time evolution of concentration** (∂C/∂t) with the **concentration gradient** (∂²C/∂x²), a **reactivity term R**, and an **experiment-inspired feature** where sterilant enters a low-concentration region upon full material penetration.  
- Using realistic parameters, the **finite volume method (FVM) diffusion-reaction model** is semi-analytically verifiable and can predict sterilant penetration time and dosage.

**Based on joint observations (my work + team):**  
1. The diffusion model helps **design experimental sterilization cycle parameters** and microbial killing kinetics.  
2. Combined findings contribute to a **catalog of scientific evidence** potentially supporting a shift away from environmentally hazardous chemical sterilants.
