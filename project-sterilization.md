# Improved medical device sterilization modality via vaporized hydrogen peroxide 
<span style="color:magenta;"> Project duration </span>: November 2022 to present
Main engagement hours: 30 hours/week 
My roles in the project: 1) **developing** semi-analytic **mathematical models of sterilant diffusion** for a variety of material geometries with corresponding verification calculations using in-house numerical tools; 2) contributing toward **microbial killing kinetics calculations and procedure development** to ascertain the efficacy of vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) as the proposed chemical sterilant at doses predicted by the diffusion modeling mentioned in 1); 3) contributing toward the **interpretation and post processing of in-house experimental diffusion measurements for VHP**
Project discoveries: Major conclusion based solely on my work with the guidance of mentors: The identified diffusion model relates the time evolution of concentration as the sterilant penetrates the material, ∂C/∂t, with the associated concentration gradient, (∂^2 C)/(∂x^2), a concentration reduction due to sterilant reactivity, R, and an in-house diffusion experiment-inspired feature whereby the sterilant enters a low concentration region (e.g. air) upon full material penetration. Using a realistic parameter set as a vehicle, the selected finite volume method (FVM) diffusion-reaction numerical model is mathematically verifiable semi-analytically and can predict sterilant material penetration time and dosage. Major conclusions based on joint observations from my work and the works of a major industrial collaborating stakeholder, and in-house microbiologists and diffusion experimentalists: 1) The current diffusion model can help design experimental sterilization cycle parameters and associated microbial killing kinetics, 2) The joint assessment from the different scientific wings of the project have helped catalogue a growing list of scientific evidence to potentially support a proposed major sterilization modality policy change away from the use of environmentally-hazardous chemical sterilants.
