## Roles & Contributions

My Contributions

- Developed semi-analytic **mathematical models** of sterilant diffusion for a variety of material geometries with verification using in-house numerical tools.

- Quantified **chemical migration** in single- and multi-layered polymeric systems, including **semi-crystalline** (e.g., polyetherurethane) and **amorphous** (e.g., silicone) materials, for industrial and clinical applications of **medical device sterilization**

- Contributed to microbial killing kinetics calculations and procedure development to determine **sterilant efficacy** at doses predicted by the diffusion modeling.  

- Interpreted and post-processed in-house experimental diffusion measurements</span> for VHP.

Collaborative Contributions  

- Provided experimental diffusion **measurements and validation** in different polymeric materials.  

- Collaborated with microbiologists and industrial partners to assess sterilization cycle parameters. 

- Integrated findings to support potential policy changes for **safer sterilization practices.**

## Key Discoveries

- The diffusion model relates the **time evolution of concentration** (∂C/∂t) with the **concentration gradient** (∂²C/∂x²), a **reactivity term R**, and an **experiment-inspired feature** where sterilant enters a low-concentration region upon full material penetration.  

- Using realistic parameters, the **finite volume method (FVM) diffusion-reaction model** is semi-analytically verifiable and can predict sterilant penetration time and dosage.

- The diffusion model helps **design experimental sterilization cycle parameters** and microbial killing kinetics. 

- Combined findings contribute to a **catalog of scientific evidence** potentially supporting a shift away from environmentally hazardous chemical sterilants.
