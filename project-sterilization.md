## Key Discoveries

• The diffusion model relates the **time evolution of concentration** (∂C/∂t) with the **concentration gradient** (∂²C/∂x²), a **reactivity term R**, and an **experiment-inspired feature** where sterilant enters a low-concentration region upon full material penetration.  

• Using realistic parameters, the **finite volume method (FVM) diffusion-reaction model** is semi-analytically verifiable and can predict sterilant penetration time and dosage.

• The diffusion model helps **design experimental sterilization cycle parameters** and microbial killing kinetics. 

• Combined findings contribute to a **catalog of scientific evidence** potentially supporting a shift away from environmentally hazardous chemical sterilants.
