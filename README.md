# WELCOME üëã
Hi, I'm Iskinder! This page is a snapshot of my professional journey ‚Äî past experiences, current work, and future interests.

## üî¨ Research Summary
I am a materials and polymer scientist with a PhD from the University of Akron and many years of experience across academic as well as regulatory settings. My current role as a research fellow at the U.S. FDA focuses on sterilant transport through polymeric materials ‚Äî a cross-disciplinary project involving materials chemistry, regulatory standards, and applied mathematics.
Prior to moving into this regulatory scientist role within a sterility and infection control subprogram, I worked on two environmental molecular science projects. The first involved a physical chemistry study of the optimum surface capture of benzoic acid, a common water pollutant, using carbon nanotubes. The second involved the molecular design of viable bio-oil material substituents to traditional asphalt materials, which are known to have a large carbon footprint. Lastly, I have been a part of a highly interdisciplinary and exploratory/basic scientific research on prebiotically plausible cell-like structures with the goal of testing hypotheses on the origin of life on Early Earth and potentially elsewhere in the universe.

## üí° Open to Opportunites
I‚Äôm interested in opportunities where I can apply my expertise in **materials science, polymers, and data-driven modeling** to solve real-world challenges.  
I enjoy roles that combine **applied R&D, regulatory science, sustainable materials innovation, and computational analysis**, especially in collaborative, interdisciplinary environments.  
I‚Äôm open to contributing to projects that advance **product reliability, scientific consulting, or innovative problem-solving**, helping organizations turn experimental insights into actionable solutions.

## üé∑ Outside the Lab
In my downtime, I enjoy activities that fuel creativity, community, and curiosity:  
‚Ä¢ Active in amateur and semi-professional music ensembles in the Washington, DC area and NE Ohio  
‚Ä¢ Engaged with local volunteer and secular discussion groups  
‚Ä¢ Passionate about promoting public awareness of science and advocating for the separation of religion and government
