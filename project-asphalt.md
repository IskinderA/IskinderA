# Green Asphalt Material Design

Project duration: January 2016 â€“ May 2020
Main engagement: ~10 hrs/week

Roles & Contributions

My Contributions

Recommended viable bio-oil substituents (e.g., soybean and corn oil fatty acids) to modify traditional asphalt binder compositions, employing an improved asphalt simulation model.

Wrote, tested, and applied de-novo analysis scripts to computationally evaluate processability and mechanical behaviors of modified asphalt binders.

Collaborative Contributions

Worked with project team to refine and apply asphalt simulation models for binder modification studies.

Contributed to joint interpretation of simulation results and material testing outcomes.

Key Discoveries

Demonstrated that overestimation of mixing and compaction temperatures in asphalt surfacing can be reduced by accurately modeling asphalt flow behavior as non-Newtonian rather than Newtonian.

Showed that bio-oil fatty acids can be incorporated into asphalt binders without compromising construction performance or long-term material properties.
